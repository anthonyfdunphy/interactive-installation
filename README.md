The interactive installation is a dynamic, immersive experience that combines movement, light, and sound. The installation features a series of interactive platforms equipped with sensors that respond to audience movements by triggering a variety of sound and light effects. To manage the installation, a custom GUI interface was created using TouchDesigner. This interface provides an intuitive tool for controlling different modes of the installation, switching between concert and installation modes, and displaying the current active lighting scene. The GUI is a critical component of the installation as it provides a powerful and flexible tool for managing the complex interactions between the audience and the platform sensors.

One of the key features of the GUI is the ability to reset the sensors on the platforms, which is especially useful when the installation is used for extended periods or in multiple locations. With just a few clicks of a button, the sensors can be quickly reset, ensuring that the installation is always ready for the next performance.
