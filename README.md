The interactive installation is a dynamic, immersive experience that combines movement, light, and sound. The installation features a series of interactive platforms equipped with sensors that respond to audience movements by triggering a variety of sound and light effects. To manage the installation, a custom GUI interface was created using TouchDesigner. This interface provides an intuitive tool for controlling different modes of the installation, switching between concert and installation modes, and displaying the current active lighting scene. The GUI is a critical component of the installation as it provides a powerful and flexible tool for managing the complex interactions between the audience and the platform sensors.

One of the key features of the GUI is the ability to reset the sensors on the platforms, which is especially useful when the installation is used for extended periods or in multiple locations. With just a few clicks of a button, the sensors can be quickly reset, ensuring that the installation is always ready for the next performance.

# Key Concepts 

TouchDesigner is at the heart of many audio-visual productions, providing a platform for creating and executing interactive media experiences. At the core of this production are key central elements that enable the production to function smoothly and efficiently.

### MIDI Communication

One of the most important features of TouchDesigner show file is the ability to automate the show's running order. This means that once the show is set up and running, it can run smoothly without any intervention. This is achieved by using the MIDI trigger notes in the Ableton session, which are mapped to functions and actions within TouchDesigner. This allows the show to be fully controlled and executed through the MIDI track, freeing up the performer to focus on other aspects of the production. This allows a certain level of flexibility for this production as much of the musical sections are freeflowing and expansive with some not clearly defined start and end points. This allows the performer/ableton operator the ability to jump around the Ableton session file without worrying about the context. The lighting scene transitions and strobe effects changes are achieved by using specific MIDI notes that are triggered at key points in the show. These notes are mapped to lighting cues within TouchDesigner, which then triggers the corresponding lighting effects. This not only creates a visually stunning show, but also ensures that the transitions between scenes are smooth and seamless.

### TD Ableton Component

The TouchDesigner session communications between Ableton and TouchDesigner with the TDAbleton component. This is achieved through the use of TD Ableton components, which enable the two software applications to communicate with each other in real-time. This allows the installation section of the show to be run through TouchDesigner, while still maintaining communication with Ableton.
